I'm a 16-year-old full-stack developer passionate about building websites, Discord bots, and Minecraft servers!

I work with modern frameworks like React, Next.js, Svelte, and Astro to create fast, accessible web apps. My backend experience includes Go, Java, and Docker, and I manage servers using Linux, NGINX, and Pterodactyl. I love automating communities with custom Discord bots and building Minecraft servers from scratch.
